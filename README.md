  This is my thesis on a Kotlin-based Android application that allows users to track expenses, income, and debts. For debts, it calculates the most optimal distribution to settle balances for everyone to reach a zero balance. The application also features a Firebase backend for authentication and persistent storage. Additionally, user data can be stored locally on the phone using a Room database, capturing the user's current information.
