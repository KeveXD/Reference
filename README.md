# Reference
These projects are my works, one of which is still in progress while another one is already completed.


* Thesis: BuXa
  
  This is my thesis on a Kotlin-based Android application that allows users to track expenses, income, and debts. For debts, it calculates the most optimal distribution to settle balances for everyone to reach a zero balance. The application also features a Firebase backend for authentication and persistent storage. Additionally, user data can be stored locally on the phone using a Room database, capturing the user's current information.


* UWP: Game Of Thrones

  This is a client-side application written for the Universal Windows Platform that fetches data about the Game of Thrones Books from an API. Within the application, these data can be navigated. It displays and lists information about characters and houses.
